## About Jornada

Jornada is the idea of an multi-tenant eCommerce platform, modular enough to be extended in every direction, easily maintainable and understandable. 

I decided to open-source Jornada, to showcase approaches of Domain Driven Design with Laravel and for learning purposes for others.

So far, examples can be found, how to modify parts of a standard Laravel application, to do things different and yet stay within Laravel style. Included is also creating a custom CLI based on artisan, as well how to leverage code generation to superspeed early development and decision changes. 

Some documentation already provides insights on the approaches taken. 

Jornada is in it's very early stages, not a full application yet. More information and explanations will follow.
